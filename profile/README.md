We're a Florida-based consultancy that partners with startups and growing businesses to build impactful, scalable software solutions. Founded in 2017, we bring a unique blend of technical expertise and organizational leadership to every engagement.

## What We Do

**Custom Software Development** — Full-stack web applications, APIs, and cloud infrastructure. We work primarily in the TypeScript ecosystem, building solutions that are performant, maintainable, and solve real problems.

**Technical Consulting** — Architecture reviews, code audits, and strategic planning. Whether you need a second set of eyes or help charting the right technical path, we've got you covered.

**Leadership Development** — Technical leadership programs, workshops, and coaching. We help engineering teams level up through hands-on training and mentorship—on-site or virtual.

## Our Background

Red Leg Dev combines 14+ years of software engineering experience across Fortune 50 companies and innovative startups with over a decade of military service as an Army National Guard Officer. This background shapes our approach: mission-focused, disciplined execution, and a commitment to developing the people we work with—not just the products.
